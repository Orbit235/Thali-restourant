                A thali is a large circular rimmed plate that holds smaller bowls filled with food.
                According to food historian K.T. Achaya’s A Historical Dictionary of Indian Food, the word “thali” comes from “sthali” which was not a plate, but a pot used during Vedic times to boil rice. 
                He describes a thali as “a circular metal dining plate with raised edges, often accompanied by deep, small circular metal bowls called katoris in which are placed accompaniments to the meal, 
                like dry and wet curries, curds and even desserts like payasam.”

                Chicken Biryani is a savory chicken and rice dish that includes layers of chicken, rice, and aromatics that are steamed together. 
                The bottom layer of rice absorbs all the chicken juices as it cooks, giving it a tender texture and rich flavor, while the top layer 
                of rice turns out white and fluffy.
